-Have a empty xml file that you can download and upload or copy and paste over the charter items, useranames, stamps, money, and other stuff.
-When logging in you can either create a penguin with just a username or you can import the stuff then you choose the month date year looks like the DeLorean or very simple arrows to flip through the stuff.
-Have all the draw images in an array with a top to bottom value so I can render everything like the old club penguin would do I can pop new penguins in and swap the array indexes for the sort order
-add date information to everything I can from the cpwiki archives/cpwiki into the js file with the room image load.
-find out how fast the penguin moves from one spot to another from old videos to get the movement speed.
-Do circle math to get the look direction and movement angle

-Using the SVG Data like the green change room zones and the greyed out no walking area, don't draw them but check for collisions or if the penguin in inside the zone to execute scripts like change rooms or cancel movement.
-To check for collisions we have 4 lines casting out from the penguins feet and checking when all 4 lines intercet with the SVG or array lines I place that match the SVG file, when all 4 lines cross it then I know it's inside the polygon/svg shape
-the svg path is already pixel coordinates so I just need to check if they intercet with the player/penguin 4 cardinal lines
